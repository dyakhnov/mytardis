4.0
---
* Django 1.11
* jQuery 3.3.1
* Improved test coverage
* Continuous Integration tests run against Ubuntu 18.04 (MyTardis v3.x used 14.04)

* Social Auth, including AAF and Google Auth via OpenID Connect
* Migrating user accounts from LDAP or localdb to OpenID Connect
* Customizable user menu
* Using message.level_tag instead of message.tags in portal_template, so that
  extra tags can be added to Django messages without interfering with the Bootstrap
  alert class.
* My Data page (which previously contained Owned and Shared experiments) has been split
  into two pages - "My Data" and "Shared"
  - Each page loads thumbnails asynchronously for faster initial page load time
  - An improved pagination widget allows for a very large number of pages.
* Index page's thumbnails are loaded asynchronously for faster initial page load time.

* SFTP can now be used with keys instead of passwords
* Upgraded Bootstrap from 2.0.4 to 2.3.2 (further upgrades coming soon)
* Fixed some bugs in single search

* Removed old broken code and unnecessary code which is duplicated in other repositories.
   - Import via staging with jsTree
   - Uploadify
* Updated or removed (as appropriate) some out-of-date JS dependencies bundled within the MyTardis repository
   - Most JS dependences are installed by npm now, so we can run security checks with npm audit
* manage.py can now be used instead of mytardis.py and mytardis.py will soon be deprecated
* New support email setting can be used in email templates or HTML templates.
* Updating loadschemas management command for Django 1.11 and adding test for it
* Updated the dumpschemas management command for Django 1.11 and added a test for it

* Added INTERNAL_IPS to default settings for template debugging on localhost
* Disabled the old publication forms app in default settings, and ensured
  that MyTardis didn't attempt to access its static content when disabled
* Removed apps code from ExperimentView's get_context_data which assumed
  that each app would provide a views module with an index
* Fixed a bug where creating a group which already existed gave a 500 error
* Fixed a bug where non-ASCII characters in experiment names could break SFTP
* Made dataset thumbnails optional - disabling them can improve page load times
* Fixed a bug which had made it difficult to delete a DataFileObject without
  a URI from the Django shell
* Fixed a bug which made search indexing fail when there were users with
  non-ASCII characters in their first or last name

  tasks in new celery versions

  Datasets and DataFiles.

  for web UI requiring every Experiment to have at least one user owner.

  images.  The carousel is now limited to a maximum of 100 preview images.

    indivdual users and groups: canRead, canWrite, canDelete,
    isOwner. Additionally, a time stamp can be specified for each
    access rule.
